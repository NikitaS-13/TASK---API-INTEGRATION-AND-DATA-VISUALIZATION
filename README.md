#DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED: 
Objective
The objective is to write a Python script to retrieve data from a public API, such as OpenWeatherMap, and present the data by visualizing using Matplotlib or Seaborn. This combines the techniques for API integration with data visualization; two essential techniques that any future data scientist or software developer would require.

API Integration:

Register for an API Key: Sign up on OpenWeatherMap (or any other public API) to obtain an API key.

Fetch Data: Use the requests library in Python to make a GET request to the API endpoint. Fetch data such as temperature, humidity, and pressure for a particular city.

Parse JSON Data: Extract relevant information from the JSON response provided by the API.

Data Visualization:

Setup Visualization Libraries: Import the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries if you haven't installed them.

Create Visualizations: Use either the Matplotlib or the Seaborn library to create a visualization. For instance, you could use bar charts or even line graphs to represent the weather data.

Customize Plots: Enhance the appearance of your plots by adding titles, labels, and legends.
